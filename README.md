# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

What I have created ?

I have created a small movies application that was mentioned in the Reactjs tutorial in Udemy: https://barracuda.udemy.com/course/master-react/learn/lecture/43467434#overview

When we launch the application using the above steps: in http://localhost:3000 we should be able to see the home page with the movies application

For my learnings, I have created a weather application which should be seen when routed to http://localhost:3000/weather

Also there is a WactchList create which can be viewd in the route http://localhost:3000/watchlist

Here Concepts that are learnt and covered are:

# Package.json

# Parcel
